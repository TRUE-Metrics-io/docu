## Get your SDK API key

For using the SDK to upload data from the integrating app (e.g. your driver app), an API key is required.
The integrating app has to set this api key (called SDK API KEY) in the initialization of the SDK (see also [here in the documentation](/functions)). 

If you only want to make some first upload tests, you can use our demo SDK API KEY 

`MSgcfnGu0p3E2KhFwTP3N5NSrCSXm54U6DI0PW51`

#### Prepare the SDK integration

Integrate the SDK into your app by following these steps:
  
1. Read [the documentation](/functions) of the SDK interface.
2. Think about, when your app requires to initialize the truemetrics SDK. Typically this is done when the integrating App is started.
3. Think about, when to start and stop the SDK. This could be for example when the driver starts a new delivery or starts with his route. Or it could be just the whole shift of a driver.

### App permissions
SDK requires location permissions (including background location) to collect fused location data that helps our algorithms provide efficient results.
Additionally, SDK requires permission to post notifications in order to show Foreground service notification. Demo app showcases creating notification channels and asking for permission to post notifications.

To ensure a smooth integration in your app, we prepared a sample integration with a basic demonstrator just for you. You can find this repository 
[here](https://github.com/TRUE-Metrics-io/truemetrics_android_demo_app_p). Just clone the repository
locally, by following these
[instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
in your terminal.

####  Software Specifications
Android SDK can run on minimum Android 7.0 (API level 24)

Most of the truemetrics customer's users have an Android system - nevertheless, we also have seen that many couriers prefer to use iPhones especially when bring-your-own-device strategy are implemented. That's why we decided to put the IOS version of our SDK on the roadmap for Q2/2025.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17
- Android Studio
- Android SDK Platform Tools
- React Native CLI

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TRUE-Metrics-io/truemetrics_android_demo_react_app_p
cd truemetrics_android_demo_react_app_p
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. If needed, configure Android SDK path in your environment:
```bash
# Add to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
npm run android
```
or
```
npx react-native start
```

## Usage

### SDK Initialization

1. Launch the app and enter your Truemetrics SDK API key in the input field

### Recording Management

Once initialized, you can:
- Start recording by tapping "Start recording"
- Stop recording by tapping "Stop recording"
- View current SDK state at the top of the screen
- Monitor any SDK errors that appear below the state

### Metadata Logging

When the SDK is initialized:
1. Tap "Log metadata"
2. Enter key and value in the respective fields
3. Tap "Log metadata" to save

### Permissions

The app will request the following permissions as needed:
- Phone state
- Activity recognition
- Location (both foreground and background)

## Project Structure

- `App.tsx`: Main application component
- `HomeScreen`: Primary screen for SDK control
- `LogMetadataScreen`: Screen for metadata management
- Android native module integration for Truemetrics SDK

## SDK States

The application handles the following SDK states:
- `UNINITIALIZED`: Uninitialized state
- `INITIALIZED`: SDK is ready for use
- `RECORDING_IN_PROGRESS`: Currently recording
- `RECORDING_STOPPED`: Recording has been stopped

## Error Handling

- SDK errors are displayed in red below the status
- Errors include both error codes and messages from the SDK

## Dependencies

- React Native
- @react-navigation/native
- @react-navigation/native-stack
- Truemetrics SDK for Android

### Expo
[instructions](https://github.com/TRUE-Metrics-io/truemetrics_android_demo_expo_app_p)

# Truemetrics SDK Expo Demo app

Adding truemetrics via Expo can't be easier.

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install expo-truemetrics-sdk
```
You may need to install additional dependencies:

```bash
npx expo install expo-build-properties
```
```bash
npx expo install expo-location
```
```bash
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```
```bash
npm install
```

Declare Android dependencies in `app.json`:
```
"android": {
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION",
    "ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION",
    "ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION",
    "READ_PHONE_STATE"
  ]
},
```

For reference, SDK uses permissions:
```
android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE
android.permission.INTERNET
android.permission.HIGH_SAMPLING_RATE_SENSORS
android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION
android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE
android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION
android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE
android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS
```

Add Maven repo for the SDK to `plugins` in `app.json`:
```
[
  "expo-build-properties",
  {
    "android": {
      "extraMavenRepos": [
        "https://github.com/TRUE-Metrics-io/truemetrics_android_SDK_p_maven/raw/main"
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

Add to `plugins` in `app.json`:
```
[
  "expo-location",
  {
    "locationAlwaysAndWhenInUsePermission": "Allow app to access location."
  }
]
```

2. Start the app

```bash
 npx expo start
```
or
 ```bash
 npx expo run:android
```
and boom you are done

###  Flutter

Using truemetrics Flutter plugin could be easier. 
See here more on how it [works](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
 

To use this plugin, just add `truemetrics_flutter_sdk` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  truemetrics_flutter_sdk: ^0.0.1
```
Go for the initialize of the SDK
```
final sdk = TruemetricsFlutterSdk();
final config = TruemetricsConfig(config: {
    'apiKey': 'your-api-key',
    'debug': true
    });
await sdk.initialize(config);
```

perform start recording
```
await sdk.startRecording();
```

or Log metadata
```
await sdk.logMetadata({'key': 'value'});
```

and finally stop recording
```
await sdk.stopRecording();
```

and you are done, was easy right :)
