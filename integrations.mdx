### IOS
Most of the truemetrics customer's users have Android system - nevertheless, we also have seen that many couriers prefer to use iPhones especially when bring-your-own-device strategy are implemented. That's why we decided to put the IOS version of our SDK on the roadmap for Q2/2025. 

### React Native

###  Flutter


Using truemetrics Flutter plugin could be easier.

To use this plugin,  by add `truemetrics_flutter_sdk` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  truemetrics_flutter_sdk: ^0.0.1
```
Go for the initialize of the SDK
```
final sdk = TruemetricsFlutterSdk();
final config = TruemetricsConfig(config: {
    'apiKey': 'your-api-key',
    'debug': true
    });
await sdk.initialize(config);
```

perform start recording
```
await sdk.startRecording();
```

or Log metadata
```
await sdk.logMetadata({'key': 'value'});
```

and finally stop recording
```
await sdk.stopRecording();
```

and you are done, was easy right :)
