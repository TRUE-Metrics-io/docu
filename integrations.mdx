## Get your SDK API key

For using the SDK to upload data from the integrating app (e.g. your driver app), an API key is required.
The integrating app has to set this api key (called SDK API KEY) in the initialization of the SDK (see also [here in the documentation](/functions)). 

If you only want to make some first upload tests, you can use our demo SDK API KEY

#### Prepare the SDK integration

Integrate the SDK into your app by following these steps:
  
1. Read [the documentation](/functions) of the SDK interface.
2. Think about, when your app requires to initialize the truemetrics SDK. Typically this is done when the integrating App is started.
3. Think about, when to start and stop the SDK. This could be for example when the driver starts a new delivery or starts with his route. Or it could be just the whole shift of a driver.

### App permissions
SDK requires location permissions (including background location) to collect fused location data that helps our algorithms provide efficient results.
Additionally, SDK requires permission to post notifications in order to show Foreground service notification. Demo app showcases creating notification channels and asking for permission to post notifications.
