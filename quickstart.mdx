### Get your API Key
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Get your API Key">
    To upload sensor data and to receive the results over the API, two different API keys are necessary. The first one is used to send data to the API and is typically used in the drivers app. 
    The second API key is used to receive the results and is mainly used in the backend, when route planning an doptimisation happens.
    
    If you only want to make some first tests, you can use our demo API Key 
    
    `MSgcfnGu0p3E2KhFwTP3N5NSrCSXm54U6DI0PW51`
    
    If you plan to use all features, request an API Key by sending us a

### Permissions
SDK requires Location permissions (including background location) to collect fused location data that helps our algorithms provide efficient results.
You can refer to Android developers guidelines to integrate location permissions and user consent. 
Additionally, SDK requires permission to post notifications in order to show Foreground service notification. Demo app showcases creating notification channels and asking for permission to post notifications.

###  Software Specifications
Android SDK can run on minimum Android 7.0 (API level 24)
