### Setup and  maven repository

Project requires Java 17. If necessary, adjust your Java version in your IDE, typically in `IDE's File -> Project structure -> SDK Location`.

As next step update your project-level `settings.gradle` file and `dependencyResolutionManagement` section by the following:

```json
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.PREFER_PROJECT)
    repositories {
        // other repositories
        maven {
            name = 'truemetrics SDK'
            url = "https://github.com/TRUE-Metrics-io/truemetrics_android_SDK_p_maven/raw/main"
        }
    }
}

```

### Declare dependency on TruemetricsSDK

Inside your `build.gradle` add the following dependency:

```json
implementation 'io.truemetrics:truemetricssdk:1.0.20'
```

### Initialize SDK

SDK behaves like a singleton object that manages its own internal state. Before actually using the SDK you need to initialize it:

```kotlin
TruemetricsSDK.initialize(
    context,
    Config(apiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY")
)
```

`Config` object also accepts Boolean `debug` parameter. Set it to `true` if you want to see LogCat output of the SDK. Make sure the parameter is `false` for release builds.

### Foreground service and notification

In order to reliably collect data, SDK starts a Foreground service and shows a notification while recording is in progress.

By default, SDK uses it's own notification for this purpose.

If you want to use your own, you can pass it in `Config` object as `foregroundNotification` parameter.

Make sure to ask user for notification permission if device runs Android 13 or later.

Below you can find sample code for creating notification channel and `Notification` itself.

Creating a notification channel using `NotificationManagerCompat`:

```kotlin
private val notificationManager = NotificationManagerCompat.from(context)

notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(
    NotificationChannelCompat.Builder("FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CHANNEL", NotificationManagerCompat.IMPORTANCE_LOW)
        .setName("Foreground service notification title")
        .setShowBadge(false)
        .build()
)
```

Creating a notification:

```kotlin
val notification = NotificationCompat.Builder(context, "FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CHANNEL")
            .setContentTitle("Foreground notification title")
            .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_notification_logo)
            .setOngoing(true)
		    .build()
```

You can find example snippets for creating a notification channel and accompanying notification in the [Demo app](https://github.com/TRUE-Metrics-io/truemetrics_android_demo_app_p).

### Status callback

Set SDK status callback to get notified about SDK state changes and potential errors:

```kotlin
TruemetricsSDK.setStatusListener(object : StatusListener{
    override fun onStateChange(state: State) {
        when(state) {
            State.UNINITIALIZED -> {
                // SDK is in UNINITIALIZED state
            }
            State.INITIALIZED -> {
                // SDK is initialized, start recording immediately if needed
                TruemetricsSDK.startRecording()
            }
            State.RECORDING_IN_PROGRESS -> {
                // Recording is in progress
            }
            State.RECORDING_STOPPED -> {
                // Recording has stopped
            }
        }
    }
    override fun onError(errorCode: ErrorCode, message: String?) {}
    override fun askPermissions(permissions: List<String>) {}
})
```

`onError` callback will be invoked when something happens that prevents SDK from operating, e.g. API KEY authorization fails, device storage gets full, etc.

Possible error codes:

| Error code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AUTHENTICATION_ERROR | API key is not valid, expired or revoked |
| UPLOAD_ERROR | Recordings couldn't be uploaded after exhausting all attempts |
| STORAGE_FULL | Device storage is full which prevents saving sensor readings |
| MISSING_NOTIFICATION_PERMISSION | Permission to post notification is not granted which means that Foreground service cannot be started |
| SENSORS_NOT_WORKING | Some sensors are not wokring as intented. Error message should indicate if any required permissions are missing |

`askPermissions` callback will be invoked based on necesarry permissions for enabled sensors in remote configuration. At the moment, list of permission can include:
- `android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE`
- `android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`
- `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`
- `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`
- `android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`

**Please note:**

We recommend that you implement status callback and handle at least SENSORS_NOT_WORKING error by stopping recording and notifying user that device may be faulty if app is given all necessary permissions but error still persists.

### Start recording

```kotlin
TruemetricsSDK.startRecording()
```

Starting the recording also starts Foreground service and shows notification supplied in `Config` in system's status bar. Recording will continue even when app exits.

### Stop recording

```kotlin
TruemetricsSDK.stopRecording()
```

Stopping recording also stops Foreground service and removes notification.

### Log metadata

```kotlin
TruemetricsSDK.logMetadata(payload: Map<String, String>)
```
SDK will serialize payload into JSON.

Most of our customers query the data by customer adresses. That means, that most costumers call the [entrance endpoint](https://docu.truemetrics.cloud/api-reference/endpoint/entrances#query-parameters) by using the customer's address as an identifier. Other customers seek more flexibility and also want to query data by an identifier for a route or a courier.

By [sending this information](https://docu.truemetrics.cloud/functions#log-metatada) from your app to our SDK, we enable you to filter the results by these identifiers later on.
If you're unsure about best practices for your use case, reach out, and we'll guide you to the best solution or take a deeper look into the [metadata chapter](https://docu.truemetrics.cloud/metadata)


### Deinitialize SDK

```kotlin
TruemetricsSDK.deinitialize()
```
De-initialization stops recording if in progress and tears down the SDK and cancels all scheduled uploads.
