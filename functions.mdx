### Architecture overview

The following diagram gives an general overview:

### Setup and  maven repository

Project requires Java 17. If necessary, adjust our Java version in your IDE, typically in `IDE's File -> Project structure -> SDK Location`.

As next step update your project-level `settings.gradle` file and `dependencyResolutionManagement` section by the following:

```json
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.PREFER_PROJECT)
    repositories {
        // other repositories
        maven {
            name = 'truemetrics SDK'
            url = "https://github.com/TRUE-Metrics-io/truemetrics_android_SDK_p_maven/raw/main"
        }
    }
}

```

### Declare dependency on TruemetricsSDK

Inside your `build.gradle` add the following dependency:

```json
implementation 'io.truemetrics:truemetricssdk:0.0.3'
```

### Foreground service and notification

In order to reliably collect data, SDK starts a Foreground service and shows a notification while recording is in progress.

SDK manages Foreground service but needs existing notification channel and a notification that will be shown so integrating your app needs to create a notification channel, provide a notification in `Config` parameter and ask user for notification permission if device runs Android 13 or later.

Creating a notification channel using `NotificationManagerCompat`:

```kotlin
private val notificationManager = NotificationManagerCompat.from(context)

notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(
    NotificationChannelCompat.Builder("FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CHANNEL", NotificationManagerCompat.IMPORTANCE_LOW)
        .setName("Foreground service notification title")
        .setShowBadge(false)
        .build()
)
```

Creating a notification:

```kotlin
val notification = NotificationCompat.Builder(context, "FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CHANNEL")
            .setContentTitle("Foreground notification title")
            .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_notification_logo)
            .setOngoing(true)
						.build()
```

You can find example snippets for creating a notification channel and accompanying notification in the [Demo app](https://github.com/TRUE-Metrics-io/truemetrics_android_demo_app_p).

### Initialize SDK

SDK behaves like a singleton object that manages its own internal state. Before actually using the SDK you need to initialize it:

```kotlin
TruemetricsSDK.initialize(
    this,
    Config(
        apiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY",
        foregroundNotification = notification
    )
)
```

`foregroundNotification` parameter is a notification that will be shown when Foreground service is running, i.e. when recording is in progress.

### Status callback

Set SDK status callback to get notified about SDK state changes and potential errors:

```kotlin
TruemetricsSDK.setStatusListener(object : StatusListener{
    override fun onStateChange(state: State) {}
    override fun onError(errorCode: ErrorCode, message: String?) {}
})
```

`onError` callback will be invoked when something happens that prevents SDK from operating, e.g. API KEY authorization fails, device storage gets full, etc. 

Possible error codes:

| Error code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AUTHENTICATION_ERROR | API key is not valid, expired or revoked |
| UPLOAD_ERROR | Recordings couldn't be uploaded after exhausting all attempts |
| STORAGE_FULL | Device storage is full which prevents saving sensor readings |
| MISSING_NOTIFICATION_PERMISSION | Permission to post notification is not granted which means that Foreground service cannot be started |

### Start recording

```kotlin
TruemetricsSDK.startRecording()
```

Starting the recording also starts Foreground service and shows notification supplied in `Config` in system's status bar. Recording will continue even when app exits.

### Stop recording

```kotlin
TruemetricsSDK.stopRecording()
```

Stopping recording also stops Foreground service and removes notification.

### Log metadata

```kotlin
TruemetricsSDK.logMetadata(payload: Map<String, String>)
```
SDK will serialize payload into JSON.

Most of our customers query the data by the customers adresses. That means, that most costumers call the [entrance endpoint](https://docu.truemetrics.cloud/api-reference/endpoint/entrances#query-parameters) by using the customers address as identifier. Others want to have more flexibilty and also want to query the data by an identifier for a route or a courier identifier. 

By [sending this information](https://docu.truemetrics.cloud/functions#log-metatada) from your App to our SDK, we enable you later on to filter the results by these identifiers.
If you are unsure about the best practice for your use case, please contact us and we will help you to find the best solution.


### Deinitialize SDK

```kotlin
TruemetricsSDK.deinitialize()
```
De-initialization stops recording if in progress and tears down the SDK and cancels all scheduled uploads.
