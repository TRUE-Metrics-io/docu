Our system is designed to accommodate the data transfer needs of our customers efficiently. Most customers prefer a daily batch export of all data, including position data and stops KPI data. To support this, we integrate with the most popular cloud providers- AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure - as well as provide a generic option via SFTP for on-premises or other cloud setups.

### AWS
For customers using AWS as their cloud provider, the setup is straightforward. Simply configure an S3 bucket with the right permission, and we will automatically update it daily with the latest data using AWS DataSync.

### Google Cloud
For Google Cloud users, the integration process is seamless. We utilize the Google Cloud Storage Transfer Service to sync your data directly into your Google Cloud Storage bucket.

### SFTP
For customers using other cloud providers or on-premises setups, SFTP offers a flexible solution. In this configuration, we push position data and stops KPI data to your FTP server daily. This approach ensures you always have access to the most recent data while maintaining a complete history for your reference.
