Using truemetrics Flutter plugin could be easier. 
See here more on how it [works](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
 

To use this plugin, just add `truemetrics_flutter_sdk` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  truemetrics_flutter_sdk: ^0.0.1
```
Go for the initialize of the SDK
```
final sdk = TruemetricsFlutterSdk();
final config = TruemetricsConfig(config: {
    'apiKey': 'your-api-key',
    'debug': true
    });
await sdk.initialize(config);
```

perform start recording
```
await sdk.startRecording();
```

or Log metadata
```
await sdk.logMetadata({'key': 'value'});
```

and finally stop recording
```
await sdk.stopRecording();
```

and you are done, was easy right :)
