## Introduction

The truemetrics SDK supports logging not only sensor data but also "metadata" from your mobile application.  

This allows you to enrich truemetrics data with specific courier events and data.

## When to Send Metadata and What to Use as a Trigger

When is the right time to send metadata? The truemetrics algorithm matches the metadata closest in time to the stop event. Most customers choose an interaction that occurs close to the actual service, such as scanning the parcel or the courier swiping to confirm arrival at the delivery location. 

Try to avoid triggers that the driver might often forget, such as marking the delivery as closed or starting navigation to the next stop, as this can lead to mismatches between the metadata and the stop data in truemetrics.

If you're unsure, either discuss this with truemetrics or use multiple triggers to send metadata. Just make sure to include the type of trigger so that the data is not interpreted as multiple deliveries.

| Example Key   | Example Value                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| type_trigger  | job_finalized / scan_performed  |
| ...           | ...                            |

## Required Metadata Fields

### Normalized Addresses

For validation, the normalized address of the delivery is required to be logged into the truemetrics data.

It is best practice to send an object similar to the following example:

| Example Key    | Example Value         |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| country_code   | DE                    |
| postal_code    | 10762                 |
| street         | Pflanzstrasse          |
| house_number   | 5                     |

### Identifiers

Most customers already have internal identifiers for deliveries, parcels, tours, and other related entities.

truemetrics automatically enriches stop KPIs, parking spots, and entrances by using these identifiers. This makes it easier you to track, check, and evaluate truemetrics data.

| Example Key          | Example Value     |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| identifier_driver    | 1234abc            |
| identifier_tour      | 1234abc            |
| identifier_delivery  | 1234abc            |
| identifier_stop      | 1234abc            |
| ...                  | 1234abc            |

### Service Type

Stop times can vary significantly depending on the type of service performed. Was it a fast B2B drop-off with a single parcel, or a more complex B2C pickup requiring a signature? You know best what is important for your business, and truemetrics allows you to enrich the data with your specific categories, enabling you to later analyze the data based on those categories.

Typical examples:

| Example Key   | Example Value        |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| type_consignee  | B2C                |
| type_stop       | pickup (or drop-off)|
| type
