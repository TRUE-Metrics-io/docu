# Battery consumption

It is challenging to provide an exact measure of the SDK's battery consumption, as many factors influence battery usage. However, we can explore two different scenarios to give a general understanding.

### Scenario 1: Existing GPS and Backend Communication
In this scenario, let's assume your app already frequently records the courier's GPS position (e.g., at 0.5 Hz) and communicates with the backend periodically using mobile data. Additionally, several background processes are running.

In this case, the SDK (Truemetrics) will not significantly increase battery consumption. Since your app is already using the power-intensive GPS receiver, Truemetrics simply reuses the GPS data. While there may be a slight increase in battery usage due to communication with the backend, it will be so minimal that it would be difficult to measure.

### Scenario 2: No Existing Location Services in your app
In the second scenario, your app currently does not use the location provider and has very limited, optimized communication with the backend. Nearly no data is send. All physical sensors are deactivated. Here, adding truemetrics will introduce some additional battery consumption. As a roght reference, battery consumption typically ends at approximately 7%-15% of the total battery level per hour, depending on the Android version, manufacturer, and phone model - resulting in 7-11 hours of operation.
