Daily, we generate a new data set, which is synced with your data storage. To give you control about the versioning, a new folder with the creation date as name is used.

### Incremental Export for Positions
truemetrics provides daily incremental exports to keep your system updated with the latest position data. Each day, you will receive a Parquet file containing the changes detected by truemetrics, including updates to entrances and parking places.

#### Contents of the Export
The daily Parquet file includes:

* Newly detected entrances or parking places
* Updated positions, e.g., more reliable location data
* Deletions, indicated by specific markers (see below)

You can use this file to update your database by iterating over each row and applying the changes to your data structure.

#### Handling Deletions
To signal that a previously provided location should be removed, truemetrics uses coordinates with latitude = 0 and longitude = 0. This serves as an instruction to delete or invalidate the previously sent position.

Example Use Case:
If truemetrics initially sent you an entrance location that was later determined to be invalid (e.g., through manual verification), the daily export will include a row with the same identifier but with lat = 0 and lon = 0.
You should interpret this as a deletion request and the position should be either removed or ignore the from your system.

# Integration Guidance
When processing the daily Parquet files:
Iterate through each row.
For each entry:
If coordinates are 0/0, delete the corresponding record by the identifier from your database.

Otherwise, insert or update the location in your database.
Ensure that your import process is idempotent and can handle re-processing the same file if needed.

### Export for Stops KPIS
For each delivery you have done so far, we provide the associated Stop KPIs for the last day. The folder structure will be 

*s3://true-shared-YOURCOMPANY/truemetrics-stops/incremental/{date}/stops.parquet*

The schema of the data can be found here in the same folder as schema file.
s3://true-shared-YOURCOMPANY/truemetrics-stops/incremental/{date}/schema.json


### Time delay between recording and export
We are processing all your deliveries at the end of the day and perform the export of the data on the end of the next day (at around 23:00 am). This results in a delay between delivery and export of 24 hours. 

Example: A data export labeled 2024-01-05 will include deliveries up to the end of 2024-01-04.
