Daily, we generate a new and complete data set, which is synced with your data storage. To give you control about the versioning, a new folder with the creation date as name is used.

### Complete Export for Positions
For each address to which you delivered so far, we export one entrance and 1â€“3 parking places.
If multiple deliveries are made to the same address, we aggregate the data for you. From the multiple deliveries, we identify and include the "best" entrance and the "best" parking places.

###  Complete Export for Stops
For each delivery you have done so far, we provide the associated Stop KPIs.

<Note> There is no need to merge data from different dates. Use the newest folder and work exclusively with the data it contains. </Note>

### Time delay between recording and export
we are processing all your deliveries at the end of the day (at 00:00 am) and perform the export of the data on the end of the next day (again at 00:00 am). This results in delay between delivery and export of 24-48 hours.
