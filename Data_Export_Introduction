## Consuming Data from Truemetrics

By default, truemetrics provides **two different ways** to consume your data:

1. **Batch Export** (commonly via Parquet files)
2. **Customer-Specific REST API**

### Batch Export
The most widely used method is the **batch export**, where all your data is provided as a Parquet file. 

Alternatively, you can use a **customer-specific REST API**, tailored to your unique use case.  
For more details and inspiration about using the REST API, refer to the [API Reference](#).

### Types of Data in Exports
A typical data export includes **two main types of data**:

1. **Stop KPI Data**  
   Contains detailed information about each stop/delivery, such as performance metrics.

2. **Location Data**  
   Includes all recorded parking places and entrances, providing spatial insights.
